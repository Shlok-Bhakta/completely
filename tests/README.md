# The Test Suite

This is a test suite to test our models to see if they are any good compared to other models out there. Results will be thrown in this readme for notes. These tests will be written by me brand new and will test random stuff like long context, short context, etc.

This is really for me to see if any of the methods I use are good and improving my models. This is not comprehensive at all as it is python only and meant to be automated for convenience.

## TODO
- [ ] Add a baseline test simple single files
- [ ] Add a test for long context
- [ ] Add a test for repetive text
- [ ] Automate the tests
